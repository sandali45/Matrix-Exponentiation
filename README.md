##Matrix Exponentiation & Fibonacci/Tribonacci Calculator

This project provides a web-based interface for performing matrix exponentiation and calculating the nth Fibonacci and Tribonacci numbers using Python Flask. The goal of this project is to showcase various matrix exponentiation methods, such as naive, iterative, and exponentiation by squaring, to efficiently compute results.

Features:
- Matrix Exponentiation Calculator: Perform matrix exponentiation with various methods.
- Fibonacci Calculator: Compute the nth Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.
- Tribonacci Calculator: Compute the nth Tribonacci number using matrix exponentiation.
- User-friendly Interface: Use a web interface to input values for matrix exponentiation and series calculations.

## Setup & Installation
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Flask

## Usage
1. Matrix Exponentiation
   You can input a matrix, select an exponentiation method (naive, iterative, or squaring), and calculate the result.  
2. Fibonacci Calculation
   Enter a number `n` to get the nth Fibonacci number using matrix exponentiation.   
3. ribonacci Calculation
   Enter a number `n` to get the nth Tribonacci number using matrix exponentiation.

## Technologies Used
- Backend: Python, Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for dynamic input/output)
- Matrix Calculation: Matrix exponentiation, Fibonacci & Tribonacci series
